class RT_distortion:
    """
    Class that handles and automatizes the production of a distortion from a step
    response measured in a scope.

    Input:
        filepath    = Path to the file that contains the measured values.
        fit_opt     = {'step','kernel_step','numeric'} defines what is
                      fitted/inverted to produce the kernel.
        fit_model   = Sets the model for the fitting (see distortion_fit_models)
        fit_guesses = Provides initial guesses for the fit.
        length      = Sets the length of the kernel to be generated
        outputfile  = Sets the name for the output file.
        opt_dict    = Dictionary allowing access to more advanced options.
    Output:
        > Plots for step function and kernel step function
        > File with kernel
